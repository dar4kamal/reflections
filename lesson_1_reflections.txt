How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It makes it so faster to get the diffferences than doing it manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    To know how and what i was thinking when first i got ideas and implement it .

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros in which i can commits at only logical change not periodically like 
    google docs 
    cons in which someone could make many commits more than google docs which 
    will make looking into the changes is harder .

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    beceause of the dependancy of some files on the file which was changed .

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see the changes made to the files with masseges say what was changed 
    git diff to see exactly the difference between two versions of file 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    as i could get back to previous versions to show what were the bugs

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for any project i start
